I'm Buddy, a fourth year Computer Science student at Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA. I admire Python.
I am enthusiastic about free software and Unix-like operating systems. I like to experiment with obsolete and obscure hardware, like the early x86-based PCs, and old operating systems that are minimally maintained or no longer maintained at all.
